## Using php and database files from github on your machine.

- For the php file, please copy file from repo folder to the htdocs folder for your XAMPP install.
    - For me, that would be copying the file from C:\CSC\INETGroup6 to C:\xampp\htdocs.
- For the database file, please copy file from repo folder to the mysql/data folder.
    - For me, that would be copying the file from C:\CSC\INETGroup6 to C:\xampp\mysql\data

Remember to copy, not move, the file from location to location, and if you make any changes to the php file, please copy it back before pushing the change to the repo.  The database is for testing purposes once you have copied it, we don't all need the same information loaded.

Also, any changes you make will be local and won't update in the repo until you copy the file to the repo.
